## Final project for UTN Mar del Plata - Tecnico Universitario en programacion career (University technician in programming)

This PHP project is a comprehensive platform designed for pet owners and pet keepers. The system allows users to register as either a pet owner or a pet keeper.

For pet owners, the system provides a feature to search for potential pet keepers. They can select suitable dates for their pets to be taken care of and communicate directly with the keepers. This ensures a smooth and efficient process for both parties involved.

On the other hand, pet keepers have the ability to manage their schedule effectively. They can view requests from pet owners, approve or reject them based on their availability, and send payment orders to the pet owners once the service has been rendered.

The system is designed with different layouts for each type of user, providing a personalized experience. Pet owners have access to features that allow them to easily find and hire pet keepers, while pet keepers have tools to manage their bookings and handle payments.

In summary, this Final project is a solution for pet owners seeking reliable pet care services and pet keepers looking to expand their client base. It streamlines the process of finding and hiring pet care providers, making it easier for pet owners to ensure their pets receive the care they need.
